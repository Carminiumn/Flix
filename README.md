### Notes
I had some difficulty when dealing with the autosize configuration. It's not easy to decide which side to align and align to where. I spend about 30 mins to set and fix autosize. 

I use iOS 14.5 beta on my phone so I found I need to use the Xcode beta to build on my phone. I also had some issue with the signature, and it took me some time to resolve it.
